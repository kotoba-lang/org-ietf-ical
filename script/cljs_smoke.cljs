  "The same parsing the JVM suite covers, run under ClojureScript.

  It exists because `parse-int` was wrong in CLJS for as long as the library
  has had a CLJS story, and every test passed throughout: the suite is `.cljc`
  but only ever executes on the JVM, where the broken formulation happened to
  be correct. A portability claim that is never run in the second runtime is
  not a claim, it is a hope.

  Run: nbb --classpath src script/cljs_smoke.cljs"
